## `💻` Contributing
Add a game! Follow the structure used in `games/rps.js`. It would be cool to add a few more games.
ps it has to be a non js game meaning it cant be run on a web editor like P5.js

To design an image or model for a game, you can play the `util:colormaker` game. Exported models can be used with the `parseModel()` function from formatting.js.

## `📝` To-Do List
